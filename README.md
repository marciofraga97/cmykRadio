# cmykRadio

This is my first project creating a web radio player using **ReactJS**. The only thing I need to do is just activating a JSON-server locally to read the database.

You can preview my project below:

* **Github Pages**: https://marciofraga97.github.io/cmykRadio/
* **Heroku**: https://blooming-island-75940.herokuapp.com/ (There's an issue with the background only on Heroku)

This site displays a list of web radio stations, a customized webkit media controls, radio icons, a audio visualizer and a digital clock. 

From the database, the radio consists of the following web radio stations from Belgium:

French radios:
* Bel RTL
* Nostalgie (FR)
* Tipik (prev. Pure FM)
* Vivacit√© (Brussels)

Dutch radios:
* MNM
* QMusic
* Studio Brussel
* Joe (prev. JoeFM)

Select one of them, wait for them to buffer and you're good to go!

Since it's my first project, I also added a radio by my choice. I really like jazz so I added a specific web radio station named Jazz Radio. :)

Enjoy!
